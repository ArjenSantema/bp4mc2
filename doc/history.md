# History, provenance and versioning
In the Catalogus, a distinction is made between the formal history and the material history of concepts. The **formal history** of a concept consists of its different versions that were stored in the Catalogus. Each change to a concept results in a new version. A certain set of **provenance information** is documented for each change, most notably the date/time when it occurred and who made the change.

The **material history** of a concept addresses its legality. Each concept has a legal status; changes in legal status usually occur at a given time. The material history of a concept documents just that.
